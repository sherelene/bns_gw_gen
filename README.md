# Binary Neutron Star Graviational Wave Generator
waveform generator for binary neutron stars using the package bajes. bajes [baɪɛs] is a Python software for Bayesian inference developed at Friedrich-Schiller-Universtät Jena by Matteo Breschi with the contribution of Rossella Gamba and Sebastiano Bernuzzi. and specialized in the analysis of gravitational-wave and multi-messenger transients. This allows for the generation of time domain waveforms with different parameters. Their github is https://github.com/matteobreschi/bajes
